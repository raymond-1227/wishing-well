# Wishing Well

I wish I was a billionare... lol

## About
The website was actually a template called "hello-express", but its original design sucked, so I added lines of codes to make the design quite better.

## Source Code

## Troubleshooting
  - The website doesn't load, it kept saying "Waking up..."!
    - The website is starting up, might take a few seconds.
  - The website kept reloading on the "Waking up.." page!
    - The website is automatically updating some packages, such as Node.js version.

## Versions

**v1**: This is my first project on Glitch (well it's just a bunch of default preset codes but i replaced those "nice" quality content)

**v2**: A better version with a better CSS design.
